# PPAC
Code and trained model for our paper **PPAC: Predicting Protein-Protein Affinity Changes Induced by Amino Acid Mutations Using Protein Large Models**
![Overall FrameWork](https://github.com/zhangzhangleilei/PPAC/blob/main/fig1.png)

<br>

## Installation
PPAC can be downloaded by following the commands below.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhangzhangleilei/PPAC.git
cd PPAC
conda env create -f environment.yml -n PPAC
conda activate PPAC
```

<br>

## Data
The dataset used can be downloaded from [data](https://github.com/zhangzhangleilei/PPAC/tree/main/data). 

<br>

## Models
We have provided PPAC model for you to use

## Generate features
If you want to use our model, please first generate the features of your own dataset according to the following code.
```bash
python generate_features/Prot/generate.py [csv] [save_path]

python generate_features/Esm/generate.py [csv] [save_path]
```
For more detailed operations, please refer to [generate_features](https://github.com/zhangzhangleilei/PPAC/blob/main/generate_features/readme.md)

## Usage[calculate ΔΔG]
You can calculate the change in protein binding affinity after mutation through the following code.
```bash
python calculate_PPAC.py [model_path] [save_path] [test_csv] 

```
